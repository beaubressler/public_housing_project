\section{Appendix A: Constructing public housing dataset}\label{sec:appendix_A}

To construct my dataset of public housing projects, I first start with the HUD 

HUD project codes contain the state abbreviation, a city code, and then the project number, separated by a dash. Some projects will also be broken up into sub-projects, with different completion dates and unit listings. I call this the "full project number", as opposed to the "project number." 

To supplement this dataset, and to check the coverage and accuracy of the HUD-CDD linked data, I also collected the locations and construction dates of public housing projects from annual reports of public housing authorities in Atlanta, Baltimore,  New York City,  \footnote{I also digitized annual reports from Boston, Cleveland, Cincinnati, and St. Louis, but these did not include precise locations. Still, I used these to check}
I also sent FOIA requests to public housing authorities.
