\section{Robustness Checks: Alternative Matching Specifications}

This appendix presents full event study coefficient tables for alternative matching specifications discussed in the main text. The baseline specification uses propensity score matching with exact matching on CBSA and redlining status. Here we present results from two alternative specifications: (1) caliper matching, which adds a caliper restriction to ensure treated and control units are sufficiently similar, and (2) matching without CBSA exact matching, which allows controls from different metropolitan areas. For these alternative specifications, we present results with Conley (1999) spatially-correlated standard errors. A separate section presents baseline specification results using standard errors clustered at the census tract level.
