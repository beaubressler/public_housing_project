\section{Robustness Checks: Alternative Matching Specifications and Standard Errors}\label{app:robustness_appendix}

This appendix presents full event study coefficient tables for alternative matching specifications discussed in the main text.

\subsection{Alternative Matching Specifications}
Here, I present the full set of coefficients from two alternative specifications:
First, I present results using the baseline matching specification but adding a caliper restriction of 0.2 standard deviations of the propensity score to drop poor matches.
Second, I run a specification  matching without CBSA exact matching, which allows controls from different metropolitan areas.

Outcomes include asinh(Black Pop), asinh(Total Pop), asinh(White Pop), and Black Share. Asinh denotes the inverse hyperbolic sine transformation. Standard errors account for spatial correlation following \textcite{conleyGMMEstimationCross1999} with 2km cutoff. Reference period is one decade before public housing construction ($t = -1$). Statistical significance is denoted by: *p$<$0.1, **p$<$0.05, ***p$<$0.01.

\subsection{Baseline Specification: Tract-Level Clustered Standard Errors}
This section presents event study coefficients for the baseline matching specification using standard errors clustered at the census tract level, rather than using \textcite{conleyGMMEstimationCross1999} spatially-correlated standard errors used in the main text.
